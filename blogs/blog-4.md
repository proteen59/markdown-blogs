## Dejavu

Here's what i think it is.
Our eyes capture data, and send them to the brain to process.
The Brain processes the info and stores the data for later to be recalled.
here chain looks like this
input-process-save-recall
in my opinion a Dejavu happens when the brain doesn't follow the chain.
input-save-recall-process
