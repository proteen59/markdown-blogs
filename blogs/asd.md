## Same Same But Different

humans. unique. thinking. observing. reacting.
there are uncountable variables to think of or predict there next move or experience but if you look from a macro perspective you will only find similarities. more and more similarities.

every human takes birth but to different environments
~~every~~  most human gets parents but different different
every human learns stuff necessary but it always differentiates from one another
every human works, but no two human works the same
every one gets married but never at the same age or with the same person
this patterns keeps on going

the pattern though same never exactly copies itself
