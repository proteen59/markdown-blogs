## Entropy
every element in the universe moves from low entropy to high entropy.

a desert has high entropy because no matter what i do in the desert, it will stay desert.
on the other hand a castle made out of a bucket of wet sand has low entropy because the slightest hit on its surface is enough to change its shape and size. very soon it will not be something to call a castle.

to change something if i need to put high efforts it means that the thing i want to change has high entropy
lesser effort means lesser entropy

**every element in the universe moves from low entropy to high entropy.**
