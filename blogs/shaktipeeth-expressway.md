The Shaktipeeth Expressway is infrastructure project in Maharashtra. Approved by the Maharashtra Cabinet on June 24, 2025, it aims to connect 12 districts from Pawnar in Wardha to Patradevi on the Maharashtra-Goa border. The project has a budget of ₹20,787 crore, with ₹12,000 crore earmarked for land acquisition. However, it faces strong opposition from farmers in the proposed corridor.

## Project Overview

The Shaktipeeth Expressway spans 802 kilometres. It is designed to reduce travel time between Nagpur and Goa from 18 hours to 8 hours. The expressway will connect key pilgrimage sites known as Shakti Peethas, enhancing religious tourism. It will link 18 religious shrines across Maharashtra and Goa.

## Funding and Implementation

The Maharashtra Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) is responsible for implementing the project. A substantial loan of ₹12,000 crore will be sourced from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO). The total estimated cost of the project is over ₹84,000 crore. The project is modelled after the Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Mahamarg, an access-controlled highway.

## Farmer Protest

Farmers have expressed strong resistance to the land acquisition process. Leaders like Raju Shetti have accused the government of corruption and ignoring farmers’ rights. Protests have been organised, including sit-ins in Mumbai. Farmers argue that the government is prioritising private interests over their livelihoods.

## Environmental Concern

The project faced delays due to environmental clearance issues. An application for clearance was withdrawn last year due to local opposition. However, a fresh environmental clearance was granted for stretches without resistance. The project is now expected to proceed, with land measurement planned to be completed by August 2025.

## Socio-economic Impact

The expressway is anticipated to boost the local economy by improving connectivity. It will facilitate easier access to religious sites, potentially increasing pilgrimage tourism. However, the social impact on displaced farmers remains a contentious issue, raising concerns about land rights and compensation.

## Recent Development

The Maharashtra Cabinet has also approved increased allowances for tribal students in hostels, reflecting a commitment to social welfare. This aligns with the government’s broader agenda of supporting marginalised communities alongside major infrastructure projects.
