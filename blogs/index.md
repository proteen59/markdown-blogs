## Hooking

Hooking is the process that makes users spend more time on platform.
There are various methods of doing this -
Choices - Giving a bunch of options all at once makes there brain to think and process and compare. This is a Rabbit Hole. all the Shopping Companies like Flipkart, Amazon does this.
Less Brainpower Needing Activities - Reels or [[Shorts]], previously known as TikToks, is a great tool, almost every company is implementing. Minimum Effort (Scrolling is the easiest task in the planet), Minimum Brain Processing, makes doom scrolling seem to be nothing. So users keep doing it.

More are there, I'll come back.
