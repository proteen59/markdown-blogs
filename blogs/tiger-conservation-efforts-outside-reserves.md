The increasing human-tiger conflicts in India have prompted the Union Environment Ministry to initiate a pilot scheme aimed at managing these challenges. This scheme seeks to enhance monitoring and protection of tigers outside designated tiger reserves. The National *Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority* (**CAMPA**) has approved funding for this initiative, which will focus on **80 forest divisions** across ten states.
<h2 style="color: brown">Background of the Scheme</h2>
The pilot scheme was approved by CAMPA’s executive committee. It aims to address the recurring human-tiger conflicts by implementing technical interventions. The initiative was discussed during the National Board for Wildlife meeting, chaired by Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.narendramodi.in/). The proposed funding for the scheme is **₹88 crore**, set to run until 2026-27.

The scheme’s primary goals include improving tiger monitoring, protection, and managing co-predator populations. It aims to strengthen forest managers through technology and collaboration with civil society. Additionally, the scheme seeks to enhance the prey base to reduce tiger-human interactions.
