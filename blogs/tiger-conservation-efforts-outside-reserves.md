The increasing human-tiger conflicts in India have prompted the Union Environment Ministry to initiate a pilot scheme aimed at managing these challenges. This scheme seeks to enhance monitoring and protection of tigers outside designated tiger reserves. The National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority **(CAMPA)** has approved funding for this initiative, which will focus on **80 forest divisions** across ten states.

## Background of the Scheme

The pilot scheme was approved by CAMPA’s executive committee. It aims to address the recurring human-tiger conflicts by implementing technical interventions. The initiative was discussed during the National Board for Wildlife meeting, chaired by Prime Minister <a href="https://www.narendramodi.in/">Narendra Modi</a>. The proposed funding for the scheme is **INR 88 crore** , set to run until 2026-27.

## Objectives of the Scheme

The scheme’s primary goals include improving tiger monitoring, protection, and managing co-predator populations. It aims to strengthen forest managers through technology and collaboration with civil society. Additionally, the scheme seeks to enhance the prey base to reduce tiger-human interactions.

## Future Directions

Union Environment Minister **Bhupender Yadav** brought into light the need for focused efforts on managing tigers outside reserves. The government plans to adopt a comprehensive approach to mitigate human-animal conflicts while ensuring the protection of tiger populations.
